1
00:00:01,472 --> 00:00:04,256
One of the things I tell young
men, well young women as well.

2
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:07,015
But the young men really need
to hear this more I think is

3
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:10,468
that you should be a monster,
You know, because everyone says,

4
00:00:10,548 --> 00:00:14,200
well, you should be harmless, virtuous.
You shouldn't do anyone any harm.

5
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:17,321
You should your competitive instinct.
You shouldn't try to win.

6
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,154
You know, you you don't
wanna be too aggressive.

7
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:20,190
If you don't wanna
be too assertive.

8
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:22,740
If you wanna take a back seat
and all of those. Like, no.

9
00:00:24,353 --> 00:00:26,430
Wrong, you should
be a monster,

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,546
an absolute monster and then you
should learn how to control it.

11
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:34,663
Being aggressive. That means
you are ready to attack.

12
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:38,886
As I always point out, this
doesn't mean you walk around with

13
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:42,882
your chest puff out ready to bang
heads with everyone around you.

14
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:47,282
It doesn't mean you confront
people physically or mentally

15
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,020
head on without a tactically
superior plan. No.

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,060
What it does mean is that you
are going to get after it.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,455
You going to move fast. You
are going to think fast.

18
00:01:00,614 --> 00:01:03,394
You are going to out think
and out maneuver the enemy.

19
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:08,730
If I think the enemy is going to attack
me, I'm going to attack them first.

20
00:01:09,682 --> 00:01:12,541
If I think they are going to
seize a piece of terrain,

21
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,003
I am gonna be there
waiting for them.

22
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:20,823
If I think the enemy is going to flank
me too late, I'm already flanking them.

23
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:30,012
I view aggression as a buyer in your
mind that says, I am going to win.

24
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:35,934
I I'm am going to battle and
I'm am going to fight and I'm

25
00:01:35,934 --> 00:01:39,700
going to use every tool
I have to crush my me.

26
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:45,933
And that is what aggression is to me
the unstoppable fighting spirit.

27
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:51,243
The drive, the burning is desire
to achieve mission success

28
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:55,219
using every possible tool,
asset, and strategy,

29
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:02,089
and tactic to bring up out
victory. It is the will to win.

30
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:09,184
And if that kind of internal relentless
aggression is your you default alone.

31
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:14,458
You will win. You think that
your competitors are better than

32
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:18,950
you that somebody who's gonna take
your position. Turn up the game.

33
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,430
Step off to the next level,
take practice boy through.

34
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,319
Put more hours here, put more
time in challenge yourself to

35
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,749
reach another mountain. Challenge
yourself to feature that is.

36
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:36,270
Challenge yourself to be a star.
Challenge yourself to win the chat.

37
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:40,052
Your haters want you
to fake. Right down,

38
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,201
make the decision that
you won't give up,

39
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,962
make the decision that you
won't give in. My why?

40
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:48,517
This pushes me to
another level.

41
00:02:48,756 --> 00:02:51,950
It pushes me to doing things
that I didn't know I can do.

42
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:57,143
It pushes me to be great. Greatness
has not only talked about.

43
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:00,324
It's about the work
that you put in.
